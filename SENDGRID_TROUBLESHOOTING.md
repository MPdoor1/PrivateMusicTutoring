# üîß SendGrid Troubleshooting Guide

## ‚ùå Current Issue: "Unauthorized" Error

The API key you provided (`SG.PPSira8sTASK_qetjDQYxw.vuqig4fyKUNRWgjDv1ud_Dnsd2vAM3S7vtAvpuamY`) is returning an "Unauthorized" error, which means:

**The provided authorization grant is invalid, expired, or revoked**

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Fix This

### Step 1: Check Your SendGrid Account
1. Go to [SendGrid Dashboard](https://app.sendgrid.com)
2. Log in to your account
3. Check if your account is active and not suspended

### Step 2: Create a New API Key
1. In SendGrid Dashboard, go to **Settings** ‚Üí **API Keys**
2. Click **"Create API Key"**
3. Choose **"Full Access"** (recommended for all features)
4. Give it a name like "Music Tutoring Website"
5. Copy the new API key (starts with `SG.`)

### Step 3: Verify Your Sender Email
1. Go to **Settings** ‚Üí **Sender Authentication**
2. Click **"Verify a Single Sender"**
3. Add `mpdoor1@gmail.com` as a verified sender
4. Check your email and click the verification link

### Step 4: Update Your Configuration

Replace the old API key in your `.env` file:

```bash
# OLD (not working)
SENDGRID_API_KEY=SG.PPSira8sTASK_qetjDQYxw.vuqig4fyKUNRWgjDv1ud_Dnsd2vAM3S7vtAvpuamY

# NEW (get this from SendGrid)
SENDGRID_API_KEY=SG.your_new_api_key_here
```

## üîç Common Causes of This Error

1. **API Key Expired**: SendGrid API keys can expire if not used
2. **Account Suspended**: Free accounts have sending limits
3. **Key Revoked**: The key may have been accidentally deleted
4. **Wrong Permissions**: Key doesn't have "Full Access"
5. **Account Issues**: Billing or verification problems

## ‚úÖ Alternative Solutions

### Option 1: Use a Different Email Service
If SendGrid continues to have issues, you can switch to:

- **EmailJS** (client-side email sending)
- **Mailgun** (similar to SendGrid)
- **Amazon SES** (AWS Simple Email Service)
- **Nodemailer with Gmail** (using app passwords)

### Option 2: Use FormSubmit (No API Key Required)
Your website already has FormSubmit configured as a backup:

```javascript
FORM_ACTION: 'https://formsubmit.co/mpdoor1@gmail.com'
```

This will send form submissions directly to your email without needing an API key.

## üß™ Testing Steps

1. **Get a new API key** from SendGrid
2. **Update your `.env` file** with the new key
3. **Run the test again**:
   ```bash
   node test-sendgrid.js
   ```
4. **Check your email** for the test message

## üìû Next Steps

1. **Log into SendGrid** and create a new API key
2. **Verify your sender email** (mpdoor1@gmail.com)
3. **Update the configuration** with the new key
4. **Test the system** to ensure emails work

Once you get a new API key from SendGrid, I can help you update the configuration and test it again!
