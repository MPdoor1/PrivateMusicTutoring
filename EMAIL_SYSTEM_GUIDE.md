# 📧 Email System Guide - Music Tutoring Service

## 🎯 Overview

Your music tutoring website has a **fully automated email system** that sends professional emails to both clients and you when bookings are made. The system uses **SendGrid** for reliable email delivery.

## 🔧 Current Configuration

**SendGrid API Key:** `SG.PPSira8sTASK_qetjDQYxw.vuqig4fyKUNRWgjDv1ud_Dnsd2vAM3S7vtAvpuamY`
**From Email:** `mpdoor1@gmail.com`
**Business Email:** `mpdoor1@gmail.com`

## 📨 What Emails Are Sent Automatically

### 1. **Client Confirmation Email** 
When a client books and pays for a lesson, they receive:

- ✅ **Booking confirmation** with lesson details
- 📅 **Date and time** (formatted for Jacksonville, FL timezone)
- 💰 **Payment confirmation** ($40 PAID)
- 📞 **Your contact information** (phone, email, WhatsApp)
- 🎼 **Lesson preparation instructions**

- 🎵 **NEW MUSIC LESSON BOOKING** alert
- 👤 **Student details** (name, email, phone)
- 📅 **Lesson date and time**
- 🎼 **Lesson type** (Online or Travelling)
- 📍 **Location/Instrument details**
- 💰 **Payment status** (PAID)
- ⏰ **Next steps** for you to follow

## 🚀 How It Works

### When a Client Books:

1. **Client fills out booking form** on your website
2. **Payment is processed** through Stripe ($40)
3. **Booking is confirmed** and saved to system
4. **Two emails are sent automatically:**
   - Confirmation email to client
   - Notification email to you
5. **Google Calendar event** is created (if configured)

### Email Templates Include:
